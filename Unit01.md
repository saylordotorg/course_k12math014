**Unit 1: Introduction to Statistical Analysis** <span id="1"></span> 
*Every discipline has its own unique vocabulary and introductory
concepts. In Unit 1, you will be introduced to several topics that you
have studied in previous math or science courses. But be cautious about
skimming through the material! You will see these topics (and some new
ones) introduced in a statistical* *context, and this treatment will lay
the foundation for the rest of the course. Pay special attention to the
concepts of population versus sample. Commit the symbols for means and
standard deviations to memory. Don't worry about memorizing the
formulas; they will be provided to you on a standardized formula sheet
for use on checkpoints, assessments, and the AP exam.*

**1.1 Statistical Terminology** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*The intent of this first section of the first unit is to introduce you
to the terminology of statistics. Please make note of the following:
quantitative variable, categorical variable, sample, population,
statistic, and parameter. These terms will be used frequently throughout
the course.*

**1.2 An Overview of Data** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*The way we collect, display, and analyze data depends on the type of
data in which we are interested. Therefore, we learn in this subunit
more vocabulary about the four main types of data: nominal, ordinal,
interval, and ratio. *

    Statistics* (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Section 1.2. In statistics, we analyze and
    interpret different types of data. For example, exam grades of A, B,
    C, D, and F are different from exam scores of 92, 85, 76, 61, and
    45. Each type is valid, but we analyze the types differently.
    Therefore, a good foundation of the types of data available and
    their classifications is important.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 25
    minutes.

**1.3 Measures of Center** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*A set of raw data is just a bunch of numbers. We learn to organize and
summarize the raw data in this subunit by calculating the familiar mean,
median, mode, and weighted mean. But we also learn to group the raw data
into quartiles and percentiles. Pay close attention to the symbols and
formulas in this subunit. You will see them again!*

    Link: Shodor: [“Plop It! An Interactive Study of the Mean and the
    Median”](http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/PlopIt/)  
        
     Instructions: Begin this exercise by entering six data values into
    the box on the right (Example: 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6). A histogram of the
    data will appear. Look below the histogram and note the values of
    the mean and the median. Now, click on the “drag block” radio
    button, and click on the “6” box, moving it up to the value 14. What
    has happened to the median? What has happened to the mean? When you
    moved the box to the value 14, you created an *outlier*, and the
    median didn’t change, but the mean did. This property of the median
    is called *resistance*. The median is resistant to the effects of an
    outlier, but the mean is not resistant, because its value is
    affected by an outlier.  
        
     Now, spend some time playing with the data and the histogram. See
    what happens if you pile all the boxes on top of each other. Enter a
    new set of data values, half of which are very small and half of
    which are very large. Then move the boxes around, seeing what
    happens to the mean and the median after each move.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 10 minutes.

**1.4 Measures of Spread** <span id="1.4"></span> 
*Assume that two cities have an average year-round temperature of 76
degrees. You want to go sightseeing in February, and you think that
either city would be a good choice. Hold on! What if City A has a
temperature of 76 degrees every day, whereas City B has summer
temperatures of 100+ degrees and winter days as cold as 10 degrees below
zero? Both can boast the same average temperature, but we also have to
consider how far from the average the really cold or really hot days
vary. That is what we call the spread of the data, and that is the
subject of this subunit. Pay close attention to the standard deviation
and the interquartile range, both of which will be used in later units
in this course.*
