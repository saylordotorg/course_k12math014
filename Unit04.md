**Unit 4: Discrete Probability Distributions** <span id="4"></span> 
*You received a check from Aunt Matilda for your birthday, and you want
to go to the bank to deposit it during your 45-minute lunch break. You
know that it takes you 10 minutes to drive to the bank and 10 minutes to
get back to school. You know that sometimes there is no waiting line at
the bank and sometimes there is a really long line, and you might drive
all the way there and find out that you don't have time to wait in line
before it's time to go back to school. Your knowledge of probability
distributions and expected values from this unit will help you make the
statistically optimal decision.*  
  
 *Probability distributions give us condensed information about possible
outcomes of both mathematical and practical situations. Probability
distributions aid us in making sound decisions about waiting in line,
buying raffle tickets, and taking prescription medications.*  
  
 *The binomial distribution is one type of probability distribution that
has a myriad of applications. What guessing strategy should I use on the
SAT? Will I get into the college I want, or won't I? What are the
chances that the football team will win every one of its home games this
season? These types of situations lend themselves to an analysis of the
underlying binomial distribution. You might be surprised at the
answers!*

**4.1 Random Variables** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*In Unit 1 and Unit 2, you learned how to organize raw data into charts,
graphs, and other displays. In Unit 3 you learned the basic ideas of
probability. Unit 4, “Random Variables,” combines these ideas of data
and probability to create a probability distribution to describe a set
of outcomes and their respective probabilities. There is a bit of theory
in this unit, but it is not overwhelming, and it is presented in a
practical context.*  
    
 *This subunit introduces new vocabulary: the difference between a
discrete random variable and a continuous random variable. We will
concentrate on discrete random variables for much of Unit 4, and then we
will study the most famous continuous random variable, the bell curve,
in Unit 5.*

**4.3 Mean and Standard Deviation of Discrete Random Variables** <span
id="4.3"></span> 
*Just as we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation of raw
data, we also need to do the same for data that is summarized in a
probability distribution. Take heed: the term “expected value” is the
same thing as the mean! Don't be misled or confused by the vocabulary.
The symbol for the expected value is E(X), but remember that it is the
same thing as the mean. *

**4.4 Sums and Differences of Independent Random Variables** <span
id="4.4"></span> 
*Students often find this topic confusing and difficult to learn and
apply. Keep focused! There are three main concepts to differentiate in
this lesson:*

-   *(1) Adding a **constant** to each value of a distribution, such as
    a teacher adding 10 points to every student’s exam score.*
-   *(2) Multiplying every value in a distribution by a **constant**,
    such as the teacher doubling every student’s test score.*
-   *(3) Adding two **distributions** together, such as adding the
    weight of a student’s sandwich to the weight of his or her beverage
    and creating a new distribution, the weight of the student’s entire
    lunch.*

     Instructions: Read Section 4.4. The first part of this lesson
    teaches you how to create a probability distribution if you are
    given general information about an event’s probabilities. The second
    part of the lesson teaches you how to combine two probability
    distributions. The formulas are a bit confusing, but they are broken
    down step by step. You should definitely take notes as you read,
    making sure that you understand each step of each sample problem’s
    solution.  
      
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour.

*The binomial distribution is a very important distribution in
statistics. Read the text carefully, watch each of the videos, and

     Instructions: Have you ever guessed on a true/false test? You will
    get practice here. Follow the instructions carefully. Your first
    exercise will simulate a single individual guessing on a 20-question
    true-false test. You will simulate that person taking the test many
    times, and you will find that the student rarely passes the test.  
        
     In the second example, you will be able to see what happens if a
    group of 20 people take the test and all of them guess. The group
    scores will post to the graph.  
        
     You can change the probability from *p* = .5 (for true-false) to
    *p* = .25 (multiple-choice) test. Your hopes of passing diminish
    substantially!

     Instructions: Relax a little and let the little balls plink down
    the pegs of this simulated machine, technically called a quincunx.
    The idea is that when *p* = .5, each ball has a 50-50 chance of
    going right or left as it hits each peg. Can you guess where most of
    the balls will end up? You can see the shape of the graph that is
    made when many balls have completed their journey. What is the mean
    of this distribution? The variance?  
        
     Change *p* to a small value, such as .10. The balls now have a
    90-10 chance of going to the left as they hit each peg. What happens
    to the paths of the balls now? What will be the shape of the graph
    that results after several hundred balls complete their journey?  
        
     Working with this applet should take approximately 20 minutes.
