**Unit 6: Conducting Experiments and Studies** <span id="6"></span> 
*A recent study revealed that breast-fed babies have higher IQs than
babies that were not breast-fed.*  
    
 *What was your reaction to this study? Did you immediately think that
any baby you ever have will be breast-fed so that he or she will have a
high IQ? Or did you see that there are other issues to consider that the
outcome did not address?*  
    
 *Unit 6 will sharpen your ability to “talk back to a statistic.” You
will learn the critical differences between a study and an experiment
and how to understand the difference between a correlation between two
variables and a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables. Big
difference!*  
    
 *You will learn about the importance of taking a representative sample
from a population and how to design an experiment that measures what you
really intend to measure. You will learn to consider issues affecting a
study that may cloud your results. *

     Instructions: Watch the video. This is an introduction to the
    differences between a study and an experiment. Knowing these
    differences will help you to better comprehend a concept that you
    will learn later, which is often paraphrased, as “correlation does
    not imply causation.”

    textbook, under the heading “Reducing Bias by Using Appropriate
    Sampling Techniques.” Review the text material discussing a simple

    you really know the definition of an SRS: “a selection of subjects
    such that every sample of size *n* has an equal probability of being
    chosen.” Pay close attention to the presenter’s use of the random
    numbers table in selecting his random sample; you will see this
    later in the review problems.

     Instructions: Read a summary of one of the most famous examples of
    large-scale convenience sampling. Then answer each question. Feel
    free to research more about this topic. The Literary Digest failure
    gave impetus to statisticians to improve sampling techniques when
    studying public opinion. George Gallup, creator of the well-known
    Gallup Poll, became a public figure when, by use of appropriate
    sampling methods, he was able to correctly predict the election
    outcome. He used a significantly smaller but more statistically
    representative sample for his predictions. Many of his political
    polling methods are still in use today.  
        
     Reading the lesson and answering the questions should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

**6.2 Experimental Design** <span id="6.2"></span> 
*An experimental design is the “big picture” of deciding how to conduct
an experiment or a study. One part of the design involves the use of the
appropriate sampling technique, which you already have learned about in
Subunit 6.1. Again, there are many vocabulary words and phrases, but
they introduce you to critically important activities that researchers
and statisticians perform on a daily basis.*
