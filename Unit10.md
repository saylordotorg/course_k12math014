**Unit 10: Chi-Square** <span id="10"></span> 
*You open a bag of plain M&Ms and your friend opens his bag of peanut
M&Ms, and you immediately notice that the two bags appear to have
different proportions of the different colors. Each of you calculates
the proportions of each color, and you are surprised to see that they
are quite different for the two candy types. You wonder if these bags
are just unusual - maybe the machine was out of whack at the factory
when the bags were filled - or if the M&M people intentionally put
different proportions of colors into the plain M&M bags compared to the
peanut M&Ms.*  
    
 *While this example is not exactly akin to the quest for curing world
hunger, it poses a question about categorical data that actually has
many practical and important implications. Up to this point, we have
only been able to do hypothesis tests for one proportion against a
particular value, or for the equality of two proportions. But Unit 10
allows us to compare multiple proportions. In our example, we can
compare the proportions of brown, blue, red, orange, green, and yellow
candies all at the same time. We use the chi-square procedures for doing
this.*  
    
 *The chi-square procedures have been used to test Mendelian genetics,
beverage preference tests, and whether drivers of red cars really do get
more tickets than other drivers.*

**10.1 The Goodness-of-Fit Test** <span id="10.1"></span> 
*We finish our course with an easy but powerful hypothesis test called
the chi-square test (pronounced ki, to rhyme with “high”). This test is
unique of all the tests we have studied because we can use it for
**categorical** data, such as which type of beverage you prefer, which
model of car is your favorite, or what is your favorite color. We no
longer measure outcomes; we simply count them. You will find that the
calculations are so simple that doing a chi-square test by hand is
actually easier than using a calculator. *

     Instructions: Read Section 10.1. This section introduces you to the
    goodness-of-fit test, in which you test your data against a
    hypothesized model of what you would normally expect. For example in
    60 rolls of a single die, about 10 occurrences of each of the six
    possible outcomes. But what if you got only 2 occurrences of the “2”
    face and 18 occurrences of the “5” face? Would this be enough to
    lead you to conclude that the die is not fair? The goodness-of-fit
    test gives you the tools to make the correct statistical decision in
    this and similar situations. Take notes and be alert for new
    vocabulary.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 45
    minutes.

     Instructions: Watch the video. Note that there is a bit of
    mathematical theory in this video, which is not a bad thing! The
    important concept to get from this video is that the chi-square
    distribution is a family of curves, not just a single curve. The
    shape of the curve is completely dependent on the degrees of
    freedom. The presenter shows you how to use a chi-square table of
    values to determine a chi-square critical value.  
        
     Watching this lecture should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Watch the video, which provides a very basic
    introduction to the chi-square procedure. The presenter offers a
    simple example using beads to show the basics of expected value and
    the calculation of the chi-square test statistic.

     Instructions: Use the applet to explore the chi-square distribution
    for the roll of a die. You already know that if you roll a fair die,
    each side has a one in six chance of coming up. This means that out
    of 60 rolls, you would **expect** each side to come up 10 times. In
    this activity, you don't know ahead of time if the die is fair. You
    will simulate rolling the die, say, 60 times. The chi-square table
    will be built for you, and you will be provided the test statistic
    and the *p* value. You will then decide if you should reject or not
    reject the null hypothesis by pressing the appropriate button. Try
    this simulation several times.  
      
     Performing this activity should take approximately 15 minutes.

**10.2 Test of Independence** <span id="10.2"></span> 
*We now use what is called a two-way contingency table for testing the
independence of two categorical variables. For example, we might want to
test to see if music preference is independent of gender or if the
letter grade a person got on the last math test is related to where he
or she sits in the classroom (front, middle, back). We are also
introduced to a test of homogeneity of two populations, and we use a
two-way contingency table as well. An example of this might be a test to
see if the distribution of blood types (A, B, O, AB) is the same for
Black, Hispanic, and Caucasian Americans.*
