**Unit 2: Visualizations of Data** <span id="2"></span> 
*A picture is worth a thousand words. In Unit 2, you will learn how very
truethis is. You will learn that every data set has a story to tell, and
you will begin the telling of that story by its graphical
representation. Just as a photographer chooses the best lighting, pose,
and camera setting for conveying an idea or mood, so does the
statistician choose the most appropriate graph or chart for best
conveying the story that the data are trying to tell.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will do more than choose the right graph; you will
also begin to look behind the scenes to discern some characteristics not
obvious to a casual observer. You will use the concepts of center,
shape, and spread of a data distribution to get both the bigger picture
and the sharper focus of what the data are saying. *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 7 hours and 45 minutes.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 2 hours and 45 minutes  
  
 ☐    Unit 2 Assessment: 1 hour

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   Read and make frequency tables for a data set.  
      
-   Identify and translate data sets to and from a histogram, a relative
    frequency histogram, a frequency polygon, an ogive, a bar chart, a
    pie graph, a dot plot, a stem-and-leaf plot, a scatterplot, and a
    box-and-whisker plot.  
      
-   Identify graph distribution shapes as skewed or symmetric, and
    describe the basic implication of these shapes.  
      
-   Compare distributions of univariate data (shape, center, spread, and
    outliers).  
      
-   Calculate the values of the five-number summary.  
      
-   Describe the effects of changing units on summary measures.

**2.1 Histograms and Frequency Distributions** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*In statistics, the graphical representation of data is the picture that
tells the story that the data are trying to convey. We will learn how to
summarize data into a chart called a frequency distribution, and then we
will learn how to create the histogram, polygon, or ogive that is the
picture that we can more easily interpret. Pay special attention to the
histogram; we will encounter it often as the course progresses!*

    (Java)  
        
     Instructions: The data in this exercise is real data about the
    duration of eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone
    Park. You can change the bin width (the width of each histogram bar)
    by moving the little triangle icon below the histogram. The
    questions to answer are:  

    -   What is the best number of bars for a histogram?
    -   Is there any one correct answer to this question?
    -   When you have many bins (bars), what is the shape of the
        histogram?
    -   What happens to the shape of the histogram when you make the bin
        width very large?
    -   What is the approximate range of the data?
    -   What is the approximate mean duration of an eruption of Old
        Faithful?

    Completing this activity should take approximately 20 minutes.

     Instructions: Complete the review questions at the end of Section
    2.1. Pay careful attention to the data values that you will use on
    the axes. For example, you will use the midpoint of each category
    for a frequency polygon, but you will use the endpoint of each
    category when creating an ogive. Similarly, the vertical axis will
    sometimes use frequencies and sometimes percentages or relative
    frequencies. Check your answers carefully with the detailed
    solution. A short answer key is provided at the end of the problem
    set. For a detailed solution, [click

**2.2 Common Graphs and Data Plots** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*We continue the theme of visual display of data with an assortment of
graphical representations, to include the bar graph, pie graph, dot
plot, stem-and-leaf plot, and scatterplot. Pay close attention to the
scatterplot; we will study it in detail in Unit 9 when we study linear
regression and correlation.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will also encounter the primary ways of describing
statistical graphs, using SOCS (shape, outliers, center, and spread).*

    Plots”**
    Link: Khan Academy’s [“Creating Box and Whisker
    Plots”](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/descriptive-statistics/Box-and-whisker%20plots/e/creating_box_and_whisker_plots) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This is an applet that gives you practice creating a
    boxplot. You are given a set of data values. Determine the
    five-number summary, and then manipulate the generic
    box-and-whiskers plot to get the right answer! This is a fun
    exercise.  
        
     HINT: When you are rearranging the data values to put them in
    order, be sure to really move the box you are dragging, all over the
    screen. It’s a bit confusing at first because the boxes don’t always
    want to rearrange to the right location.  
        
     Make sure you check your answer by clicking on the “Check Answer”
    box on the right. After you get the correct answer, feel free to
    move on to Problem \#2.  
        
     Completing this exercise should take approximately 30 minutes.

    Be accurate with your boxplot sketches, so that your description of
    SOCS (shape, outliers, center, and spread) is correct. A short
    answer key is provided at the end of the problem set. For a detailed
    solution, [click
