**Unit 5: The Normal Distribution** <span id="5"></span> 
*Your SAT scores are here! You scored 520 on Math and 600 on Verbal.
Should you jump for joy, or should you groan and sign up for a retest
date?*  
    
 *While there are many factors affecting your reaction, it will always
be useful to know how your performance compares to that of others who
took the test.*  
    
 *SAT scores, IQ scores, cockroach lengths, gestation time of elephants,
and a multitude of other measures follow a bell shape, or normal,
distribution. In this unit, we will study the normal curve in great
detail. Knowledge of the normal curve, its characteristics, and the
calculation of probabilities for variables that are normally distributed
is critical to success in this course. In addition, you will find out
how easy it is to determine how well you fared on the SAT or if the used
car you want to buy is overpriced. *

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 9 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 3 hours and 5 minutes  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.2: 2 hours and 55 minutes  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.3: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Unit 5 Assessment: 1 hour

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   Identify the characteristics and properties of a normal
    distribution.  
      
-   Identify and use the Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule) for normal
    distributions.  
      
-   Determine whether a data set corresponds to a normal distribution.  
      
-   Calculate *z*-scores and areas under a normal probability curve
    using either a table of values or a graphing calculator.  
      
-   Apply the characteristics of a normal distribution to solving
    problems.

**5.1 The Standard Normal Probability Distribution** <span
id="5.1"></span> 
*The normal, or bell-shaped, curve is the most widely used distribution
in statistics. We first are introduced to its properties and its use.
You will be provided tables and calculator instructions for calculating
probabilities pertaining to the normal curve.*
