**Unit 3: Probability** <span id="3"></span> 
*Penelope wants to be a lawyer and is trying to decide which of two
colleges to attend. College A costs considerably more than College B,
but a higher percentage of graduates of College A is accepted into the
law school than the percentage of graduates of College B. Also, the
prelaw curriculum is more difficult at College A than College B, so she
might not have as competitive a GPA if she attends College A. Penelope
is overwhelmed with the comparisons of cost, acceptance rates, and so
forth, while trying to decide which college to attend.*  
    
 *While this is a personal decision for Penelope, her knowledge of
probability theory will help her make the decision and be satisfied that
she made the best decision for her unique circumstances.*  
    
 *Probability is everywhere, and you make decisions every day based on
your own personal probabilities or on the probabilities calculated for
you or by you. Should you drive in the rain and face a higher accident
probability, or should you choose to wait until the rain subsides and
risk being late for an important job interview? Should you buy a cheaper
used car that might soon need repairs or a more expensive new car with
an extended warranty? Should you enroll in an SAT prep course to improve
your test scores?*  
    
 *The study of probability in Unit 3 will give you tools for
understanding the use of probability theory in making both statistical
and personal decisions. You will learn about sample spaces and mutually
exclusive and independent events and how to calculate their
probabilities.*  
    
 *The critical concept of conditional probability will also be
addressed. You will put all of these concepts together to have a solid
understanding of probability, and this foundation will provide you with
the skills to use probability concepts later in the course and in life
to help make sound decisions.*

**3.1 Events, Sample Spaces, and Probability** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*We begin our study of probability with the basics. We are introduced to
new vocabulary and a statistical approach to describing outcomes of

**3.2 Compound Events: Concepts and Notation** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*This subunit continues vocabulary building by introducing you to
compound events, which are composed of two or more simple events. We
also learn about combining two or more sets by considering the union of
the sets or the intersection of the sets.*

     Instructions: Watch the video. The presenter gives excellent
    examples for finding the union of two sets. Pay close attention to

**3.3 The Complement of an Event** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*If the weather reporter says there is a 30% chance of rain today, then
there is a 70% chance that it will **not** rain. These two events,
“rain” and “not rain,” are complements. This straightforward concept is
used often in statistics, so it is wise to master it.*

**3.4 Conditional Probability** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*Conditional probability is one of the most challenging concepts in
statistics. It takes time to master it. Please read the text material
very carefully and slowly, making sure you are actively reading for
comprehension. Watch the videos, complete the checkpoints, and come back
to the text and reread it. *

     Instructions: This is an applet that gives you some play time as a
    contestant on the popular TV show “Let’s Make a Deal.” You are now
    the contestant and you make the decision about whether you should
    keep the door you originally chose or whether you should switch.  
        
     Try 100 simulations. Your wins and losses will be displayed. At the
    end of 100 simulations, you will be a believer that the presenter
    was absolutely correct in the Khan Academy video about the same
    topic.  
        
     Note that you will click once for your first choice. Then one of
    the doors you did NOT choose will display its nonwinning prize.
    After this, you will have two choices: You will either click again
    on your original door, or you will switch by clicking on the door
    you did not originally choose. The action is very fast, and it will
    probably take you a few times to become familiar with how the game
    works. Just work slowly at first, and you will get into the flow of
    the game.  
        
     Performing this exercise should take approximately 15 minutes.

    will discover that some problem types are easier to solve by using
    the formula, and others are easier to solve by using the natural
    frequencies approach. A short answer key is provided at the end of
    the problem set. For a detailed solution, [click

**3.6 Basic Counting Rules** <span id="3.6"></span> 
*In this lesson, concentrate your attention on the difference between
permutations and combinations. Study the rules and formulas of
combinations carefully, because combinations will appear again when you
study the binomial distribution in a later unit.*  
  
 *Additional Note: This is the final section of Unit 3. If you scroll
down below the review question set at the end of the section in the
text, you will see a list of important ideas and formulas from the
entire unit. This is an extremely helpful list for review.*

    partially adapted from David Lane’s *Online Statistics Education: A
    Multimedia Course of Study* and CK-12: *Advanced Probability and
    Statistics* (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Section 3.6. Take notes first on the use of the
    Multiplicative Rule for Counting, such as the number of different
    outfits you can make if you have five tops and three bottoms. Then
    work on the Rule for Permutations, which is used when the order of
    items is important, such as the number of ways you can put five
    books into a bookshelf. Finally, give attention to the Rule for
    Combinations, which is used when the order of items is not
    important, such as choosing three people to plan a party from a club
    with 40 members.  
      
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 40
    minutes.

    Link: Khan Academy’s
    [“Permutations”](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-and-combinatorics-topic/permutations_and_combinations/v/permutations) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the video. The key concept in permutations is
    that the **order** in which events happen is important. The
    presenter introduces us to the general formula for calculating the
    number of permutations that can occur for a set of events.  
        
     Don't let the mathematical symbol for a factorial scare you.
    Remember that 5 factorial, for example, is symbolically expressed as
    5! and it is equal to 5×4×3×2×1=120.

     Instructions: Watch the video. When we study combinations, the
    **order** of the events doesn't matter. That is what differentiates
    combinations from permutations. The presenter concentrates on
    combinations in this video, so listen carefully when he talks about
    the fact that the order doesn't matter when we do combinatorial
    math.
